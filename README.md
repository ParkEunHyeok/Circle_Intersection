# Circle_Intersection
Gets the intersecting area of two circles using geography.

A program that uses a folium package to mark a user and a building as a circle on a map, and determines whether there are people in the building by obtaining the cross area of the two circles.

In this program, we set the latitude and longitude of our school as the coordinates of the building and the entrance to our school's main entrance as the coordinates of the person.
In order to see the results shown in the gps, you need to see them in the environment such as colab, jumpyter notebook, etc., not in GitHub.
